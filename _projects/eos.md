<div style="text-align: justify;">
In an innovative fusion of art and technology, the LightTrace Mirror introduces a versatile system that transcends traditional boundaries. Equipped with two distinct modes—Mirror Mode and Art Mode—the display can either reflect real-time LED silhouettes of users in Mirror Mode or transform into a dynamic art canvas in Art Mode, showcasing artistic interpretations of movements and surroundings. Utilizing advanced image recognition and real-time processing technologies like OpenCV and MediaPipe, this system is designed to enhance both personal and commercial spaces by creating immersive, interactive experiences. Ideal for a variety of settings, it promises a new way of interacting with digital media, where technology not only complements but elevates the human experience.
