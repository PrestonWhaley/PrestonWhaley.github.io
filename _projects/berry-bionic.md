## ■ INTRODUCTION
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Navigating a brown 16’ x 4’ playing field devoid of navigation lines, with a 4-inch tall border and two rows housing between eight and twelve strawberry plants each, presents a novel challenge in the 2024 ASABE Student Robotics Challenge. Set against the backdrop of simulated strawberry farming, this year's competition requires autonomous robots to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy leaf clusters, and flowers, executing precise trimming tasks. With each plant possessing six to eight stems, topped with a mix of green, yellow, and white clusters, the complexity and diversity of tasks mirror the meticulous care needed in real-world agricultural settings. This competition not only tests technical skills and innovation but also simulates the demanding environment of agricultural robotics, making it a critical learning arena for both undergraduate and graduate students.
