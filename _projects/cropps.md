## â–  INTRODUCTION
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Routine transfers of plant tissue to freshly prepared culture medium post Agrobacterium-infection is one of the most tedious parts of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Due to the use of the antibiotics to control Agrobacterium growth, and the instability of antibiotics in culture medium, the transformation process requires first weekly, then bi-weekly transfers to freshly prepared plant regeneration medium for the lifetime of an experiment. Depending on the plant species, an experiment lifetime spans 6 - 12 months. As the number of concurrent experiments on plant transformation can be quite large, technicians require approximately 40 hours per week to dedicate to transferring plant tissues, in many cases can reach up to 250 tissues per experiment. The repetitive, labor intensive, inconsistencies in quality, and monotonous low intellectually stimulating tasks can be completely avoided through automation of tissue transfer using a multi-axis gantry system with suction fingers.
