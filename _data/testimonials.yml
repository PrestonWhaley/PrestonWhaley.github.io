  text: My personal interactions with Preston have always been uplifting, provocative, and enlightening. Preston is mannerable and his presence is always felt in the room. I watched him develop his academic, communication, analytic, leadership, athletic, and people skills to be a well-rounded individual. He made a lasting impression.

  text: "Preston is a delightful individual who is easy to talk to and well-liked by others. He has a great sence of humor and while confident in his identity and abilities, he remains somewhat humble about the magnitude of his academic successes on campus and in the athletics arena. In my conversations with Preston, I have come to appreciate him as an emerging professional with great potential to be a leader, and role model for others"
